This is the code for learning RNN and LSTM algorithms.

Algorithms are implemented using both Numpy and Theano to see all details.

An easy example for sentence breaker implemented with Keras is also included.

The detailed explanation of RNN and LSTM, together with the basic usage of Keras, are in the docs.
